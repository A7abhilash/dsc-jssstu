It was a successful program in which 164 students enrolled themselves from JSS STU. The program introduced students to Computing, Application Development, Big Data & Machine Learning using Google Cloud's training platform called Qwiklabs where they learnt each of these topics using self-paced labs that provided them temporary credentials to Google Cloud Platform, so that they could learn about cloud without any simulations.All the students who completed the quests expressed their gratitude for giving them an amazing opportunity to learn about the happenings of cloud. All of them wished that such mega events should be organized time and again giving the students a chance to amplify their talents as they prepare for their future.",
